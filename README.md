###  Welcome to my Github

 I am a full-stack software engineer currently working as Sênior Software Engineer of zenvia.com.br .

 I have been working with tech since 2014, and during this time I worked building and scaling some awesome projects. I love being part of a team and
 making tech possible. 



### About me

 + 🇧🇷 I am from Brazil.
 + 🚀 I am trying to make a better world through coding.
 + 🦖 My favorite programming language is Javascript.
 + 👨🏻‍🏫 I love to teach and share knowledge.
 + 🕹 I learned my first programming language to make games with RPG Maker.
 



### Projects that I am proud of

 - Currently, we are building [Pingback.com](https://www.pingback.com), a place where people can engage, monetize and measure their audience. We have 200k+ users and a team of 22 people. I am very proud of being Pingback CTO, to have written the first code lines, and to be part of something that can help people communicate with their audience.
 - In 2019 we built an awesome eduacational platform for the beauty market. We worked directly with [Wella](https://www.wella.com/) to build an awesome platform that makes me very proud of the team that I helped to lead. [WellaEdu](https://www.wellaedu.com.br)
- In 2016 I've been the first developer and then lead developer of [Mercatório](https://www.mercatorio.com.br). Mercatório was a huge success in providing structured data of financial papers of Brazil. We have delivered a platform that was capable of giving Big Data to banks and investment firms so they can elaborate better market strategies.
- In 2019 and 2022 I led two projects to help people to learn everything they needed to become Software Developers. In the last batch (Jun/2022) we have helped 17 people to start their careers.
