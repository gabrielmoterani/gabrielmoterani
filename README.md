###  Welcome to my Github

 I am a full-stack software engineer currently working as Senior Software Engineer @ Lemon.io.

 making tech possible.

### Projects that I am proud of

- **2024**: As a Staff Engineer at [Zenvia](https://www.zenvia.com) (NASDAQ: ZENV), I led the development of a new micro-frontend architecture for the platform. The launch was a major success, attracting over 1,000 paying customers.  
- **2020**: I co-founded [Pingback.com](https://www.pingback.com), initially a Substack competitor. Over time, it evolved into a platform that enables companies to engage with their customers through blogs, newsletters, lead conversion pages, and other tools.  
- **2019**: I played a key role in building an educational platform for the beauty industry, working closely with [Wella](https://www.wella.com/) to develop [WellaEdu](https://www.wellaedu.com.br). This project remains one of my proudest achievements, thanks to the incredible team I helped lead.  
- **2016**: I joined [Mercatório](https://www.mercatorio.com.br) as its first developer and a co-founder and later became the lead developer. Mercatório transformed access to structured financial data in Brazil, delivering a platform that empowered banks and investment firms with Big Data insights for market strategy.  
- **2019 & 2022**: I led initiatives to help aspiring developers kickstart their careers. In our most recent cohort (June 2022), we successfully guided 17 individuals into the software development industry.
